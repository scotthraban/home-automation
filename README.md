A collection of different parts of the home automation solution that I have built up over time for my house. The longer that things have been running, the less that I remember how they work, and where to find all the bits that go into each part of the whole.

So this is really more for me than for anyone else, but if anything I put up here ends up being helpful to anyone else, that would be awesome.
